Test Case Title: Login with Valid Username and Password
Step 1: Prompt user for username and password
Expected Result: Successful login
Reasoning (Why this test case is important): This test case validates that the application correctly prompts the user for their username and password, ensuring they enter them correctly.
Step 2: Check if username exists in database
Expected Result: Username found and password entered
Reasoning (Why this test case is important): This test case verifies that a successful login occurs when the application successfully retrieves and validates a user's credentials from the database. If the username does not exist, an error message should be displayed to the user.
Step 3: Check if password matches entered password
Expected Result: Password verified and user logged in
Reasoning (Why this test case is important): This test case ensures that when a successful login occurs, the application properly retrieves and validates a user's credentials for authentication purposes. A potential security issue could arise if passwords were not validated properly during login.
Step 4: Verify user can access relevant resources and pages
Expected Result: Successful login and access to relevant resources and pages
Reasoning (Why this test case is important): This test case ensures that users who log in successfully are able to access the application's most essential features, such as accessing specific products or services.
